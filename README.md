# text-mining-political-parties-classification

**Task 3 of the 2009 edition of the Text Mining Challenge (DEFT): learning
classification by political party of interventions in the European Parliament**

This project was carried out as an implementation of the knowledge obtained during the class “Apprentissage Artificiel” with Loïc Grobol for the first semester of the second year of masters in the NLP program at Paris Nanterre University. 

With all the technological advancements we’re having in the past few years, resources and amounts of data substantially increased, leaving the task of understanding and analyzing it difficult and time-consuming because of the unstructured nature of said data. In order to overcome this hurdle, we can deploy automatic technique such as Text Classification. Text Classification is a machine learning technique for assigning predefined categories or labels to unstructured text data. It is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). The goal of the third task in the DEFT challenge is to automatically classify interventions made by members of the European Parliament (MEPs) into different political parties based on the text of the interventions.

You'll find the test, train and reference data in the adequate folders. The files of train and test data are compressed in zip format due to their size. 
Our technical documentiation is in the pdf file and our code in both ipynb and py formats.
